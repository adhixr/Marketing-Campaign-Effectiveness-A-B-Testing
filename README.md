Marketing Campaign Effectiveness A/B Testing


PROBLEM STATEMENT - 

We have the data of 64000 customers who were chosen post experiment design
and sent a marketing campaign. 1/3rd each received a email for either Men’s/Women’s merchandize vs
control group (1/3rd) which received no email. 

The aim of this project is to utilize metrics such as response
rate and conversion rate to analyze the A/B Testing and effectiveness of marketing campaign. 


Which campaign was successful, by how much and to whom? What can we learn from this campaign and how can
we make it better to improve sales?

R Code and Report are available in the repository.
